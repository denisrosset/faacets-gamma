# Canonical Bell Expressions

To consider a Bell expression for inclusion in the `Faacets` database, the Bell expression should be `canonical` (see the this keyword description). In addition, the file should not provide lower bounds, as only upper bounds are allowed.

The canonical objects are stored in the `canonical` folder, have only integer file names starting from `1`.

The `maximal` remarkable form of a canonical Bell expression has always to be present.
