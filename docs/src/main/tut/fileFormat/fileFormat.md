# Faacets file format (beta 2)

The Faacet interchange file format is used to exchange information about Bell expressions, oriented Bell expressions and Bell and Bell-like inequalities. It could be extended in the future to describe correlations, for example to classify non-signaling boxes.

The format is based on the YAML file format version 1.2 (see [YAMLSpec](http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html)), a human-readable file format which can be parsed in all major programming languages. Its information is thus organized in a hierarchy of keys, lists, mappings, etc.

 -   [Lower and upper bounds](fileFormat/bounds.html)
 -   [Keywords](fileFormat/keywords.html)
 -   [Decomposition and remarkable forms](fileFormat/decomposition.html)
 -   [Transforms](fileFormat/transform.html)
 -   [Bell expression symmetries](fileFormat/symmetries.html)

 -   [Canonical Bell Expressions](fileFormat/canonical.html)
