# Affine transformations

Bell inequalities are invariant under addition and multiplication applied on both sides, like standard inequalities: $$x \geq a \ \ \leftrightarrow\ \  x+1\geq a+1\ \  \leftrightarrow\ \ 2(x+1) \geq 2(a+1). $$ Two sets of Bell inequality coefficients that differ by a constant therefore describe the same inequality.

A general affine transformation can be described by `affine(...)=ax+b`. For instance, twice the CHSH inequality is: ..., which has a local bound of 4.
