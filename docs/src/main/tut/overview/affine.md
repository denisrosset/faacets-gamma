# Affine transformations

As any other inequality, a Bell inequality is invariant under addition and multiplication applied on both sides: $$x \geq a \ \ \leftrightarrow\ \  x+1\geq a+1\ \  \leftrightarrow\ \ 2(x+1) \geq 2(a+1). $$ Two sets of Bell inequality coefficients that differ by a constant therefore describe the same inequality. This equivalence applies to all affine transformation `affine(...)=ax+b`.
