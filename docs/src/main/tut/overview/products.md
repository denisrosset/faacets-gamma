# Composition of Bell expressions

Just like it is possible to add inputs and outputs to a Bell inequality through a [lifting operation](liftings.html), supplementary parties can also be added into a Bell test. One natural way of doing this, which preserves the facet property of the original inequalities, consists in taking the product of .

For instance, it is possible the bipartite [CHSH inequality](http://faacets.com/3), which belongs to the scenario `[(2 2) (2 2)]` with the [Froissard inequality](http://faacets.com/4) belonging to the `[(2 2 2) (2 2 2)]` scenario. This results in an inequality which belongs to the 4-partite `[(2 2) (2 2) (2 2 2) (2 2 2)]` scenario, and is a facet of the local polytope. Another example is the product of two CHSH inequalities, which belongs to the `[(2 2) (2 2) (2 2) (2 2)]` scenario. [write this inequality explicitely?]

The simplest way of adding parties to an inequality, is to combining it with the positivity constraint expressed for the remaining parties. This particular composition is sometimes referred to as the _party lifting_ of the original inequality.

As a result of the possibility of composing inequalities by taking their product, a multipartite inequality may be _composite_, if it is the product of more than on inequality. Such an inequality is not _canonical_.
