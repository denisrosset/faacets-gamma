## Contributing to Faacets

As of March 2017, our development is done (mostly) in the open. Currently, we do not accept feature requests or code extensions, as we need to stabilize the code base. 

Feel free to write us if you want to help with the stabilization: you need to be familiar with Scala and with the mathematical formalism of nonlocality.
