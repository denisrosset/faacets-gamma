## Contributing to Faacets

Starting from March 2017, the development is done in the open. Our current focus is to reach feature parity with the former beta version still online on http://faceets.com.

Our current focus is to stabilize the mathematical algorithms and write an unambiguous specification for the file format.

We welcome any help towards that goal.
